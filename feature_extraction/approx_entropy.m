function [apen] = approx_entropy(n,r,a)


%% Code for computing approximate entropy for a time series: Approximate
% Entropy is a measure of complexity. It quantifies the unpredictability of
% fluctuations in a time series

% To run this function- type: approx_entropy('window length','similarity measure','data set')

% i.e  approx_entropy(5,0.5,a)

% window length= length of the window, which should be considered in each iteration
% similarity measure = measure of distance between the elements
% data set = data vector

% small values of apen (approx entropy) means data is predictable, whereas
% higher values mean that data is unpredictable

% concept boorowed from http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/ApEn/
